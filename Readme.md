# Installation and Quickstart

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed.  
2. Install dependencies either by:  
   - Using pdm (preferred):  
     » pdm install  
   - Or manually with pip:  
     » pip install -r requirements.txt  

## Quick-Start
1. Configure Foundry environment variables, which will be pulled in via the model in src/flow/config/base_settings.py:
   - export FOUNDRY_EMAIL='your_email@example.com'  
   - export FOUNDRY_PASSWORD='your_password'  
   - export FOUNDRY_PROJECT_NAME='your_project_name'  
   - export FOUNDRY_SSH_KEY_NAME='your_ssh_key_name'

2. Get familiary with the flow_example.yaml file, which contains a comprehensive example of a Foundry task definition via the CLI. 

3. Submit an example task using flow_example.yaml:
   » flow submit flow_example.yaml

4. Check the status of your submitted task:
   » flow status

Note, we have yet to tune the CLI/ to be more ergonomic and stylish. More work to do on the UI. Placeholder UI logic is in the 'formatters' folder. 

5. Look through and experiment with the flow_sdk_quickstart.ipynb file, which contains an interactive notebookquickstart guide to using the Foundry SDK.

# FCP Hierarchical Structures and Ergonomic Improvements 

## FCP convenience taxonomy

A **task** is an atomic, irreducible unit that maps to an all-or-nothing _request_ for infrastructure from FCP. 

Most users think of their experiments not in terms of tasks, per se, but rather in terms of **jobs**. A **job** is a meta-concept which subsumes that of tasks. A job can be composed of: 

* Logic around a <u>single task</u>. A single task request specifies a single <u>fcp_instance</u>, or explicit GPU type and networking config. However, when multiple types can be viable, but with a preferred order or optimization objective (minimal cost, fastest job completion time), advanced users can add metadata to give FCP the leverage to optimize on the user's behalf. 
* Specification of <u>multiple tasks</u> to be executed independently or in succession. 



### Tasks

A **task** specification maps to a requests for infrastructure from FCP. 

FCP's scheduling mechanism is inspired by economic concepts of **utility** and **surplus maximation**. 

We internally leverage a **second-price auction** mechanism, which helps ensure that infrastructure is put to <u>best-use</u> whilst allowing users to state their job's *utility* <u>truthfully</u>, since they won't be charged their **utility_threshold_price**, but rather the **second_price** of the job their job is displaying when there is overlapping demand for all resources (or the minimum threshold price, when excess nodes are available.) 

Under this mechanism, the game-theoretically optimal approach is to state one's utility_threshold_price honestly. 

This all allows Foundry to <u>maximize global utility across all users and jobs</u>, and can be more efficient than a fixed_price system. 

### Attributes of Tasks

Foundry **tasks** are defined by the following attributes:

```YAML
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Foundry Task Configuration
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file provides a comprehensive configuration for defining a Foundry task.
# Each section explains both required and optional fields, guiding you in
# tailoring your workflow. Update or uncomment fields according to your needs.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [1] Task Name (Optional)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A human-readable, descriptive name for this task. Appears in Foundry UIs.
# If omitted, a default or auto-generated name may be used.
name: flow-tsk-my-test-5

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [2] Foundry Task Management
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Parameters for how Foundry schedules, prices, and manages this task.
task_management:

  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 2.1 Priority (Optional)
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Defines a shorthand for setting a utility price threshold.
  # Foundry uses these utility thresholds to optimize global utility across all tasks.
  # Valid options: [critical, high, standard, low].
  # If not specified, defaults to 'standard' or the configured default in the 'flow_config' file
  # Set values in the 'flow_config' file to override defaults.
  priority: low  # Example for lower priority 'batch' tasks

  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 2.2 Explicit Utility Threshold Price (Optional)
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # A direct per-GPU limit price (spot_bid). If left out, Foundry calculates
  # the spot_bid based on the 'priority' field above. 
  # Note, Foundry utility maximization is mbased on a second price auction, so users aren't charged their utility price but rather a guaranteed lower rate.
  # Thus, users can set the utility threshold price to their 'true utility threshold'.
  utility_threshold_price: 2.24  # Example low priority custom price for a batch task

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [3] Resource Configuration
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Specify the compute resources needed for the task.
resources_specification:

  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 3.1 Instance Type
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # The name of the GPU instance type. Adjust according to your project's
  # performance requirements or availability in a given Foundry cluster.
  fcp_instance: h100-80gb.SXM

  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 3.2 Number of Instances
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Total instances to request. By default, a single instance is allocated.
  # Increase for tasks that need multi-instance processing in an all-or-nothing
  # configuration (e.g., distributed training).
  num_instances: 1

  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 3.3 Cluster ID (Optional)
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Restrict task placement to a specific cluster or region if needed.
  # Uncomment and set the cluster_id to choose a region (e.g., "us-central1").
  # cluster_id: us-central1

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [4] Ports to Expose (Optional)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define which ports or port ranges to expose for external access, such as for
# Jupyter or TensorBoard. You can specify single ports (e.g., "8080"), ranges
# (e.g., "6006-6010"), or pair external and internal ports explicitly.
ports:
  - 8080              # Single port exposed externally and internally
  - 6006-6010         # Expose port range externally and internally
  # You can also map external ports to different internal ports or ranges:
  - external: 8441
    internal: 8001
  - external: 8442
    internal: 8002
  - external: 8443-8445
    internal: 8003-8005

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [5] Storage Configuration (Optional)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configure persistent storage volumes to be mounted on the task instance.
# This is particularly useful for sharing data, storing checkpoints, or
# accessing large datasets. Uncomment and fill out the relevant fields.

persistent_storage:
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 5.1 Create a New Volume (Optional)
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Provide the desired volume name, size, type, region, and mount point.
  create:
    volume_name: my-new-volume           # Custom label for your volume
    storage_type: block                  # Options: 'block' or 'nfs'
    size: 1                              # Size in GB
    mount_point: /mnt/my-new-volume      # Where volume is mounted on the instance
    region_id: us-central1-a             # Region/zone for storage
    disk_interface: Block                # Usually 'Block' for block-based volumes

  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 5.2 Attach an Existing Volume (Optional)
  # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Instead of creating a new volume, attach an existing one by name.
  # Uncomment and fill out to attach your pre-existing storage.
  # attach:
  #   volume_name: existing-volume-name
  #   mount_point: /mnt/existing-volume

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [6] Startup Script (Optional)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Provide commands that will execute upon instance initialization, enabling
# you to install dependencies or run initial setup tasks automatically.
startup_script: |
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Starting setup..."
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  echo "Setup complete."

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [7] Versioning
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Indicates the format version of this configuration file.
version: 1
